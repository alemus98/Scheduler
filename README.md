# Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calender scheduler tool that lets users record and save events from 9am - 5pm on the current day. If the row with the time labeled is green, then it signifies that the hour has not passed yet. If it is red, then it is currently that time. If it is grey, then that hour has passed. 

The sceduler can be found found here! https://alemus98.github.io/Scheduler/
